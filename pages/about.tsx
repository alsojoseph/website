                    Hey! I'm a 17 y/o full-stack software developer from the
                    United Kingdom. I've been programming for just under 3
                    years; in which time I've picked up many different skills,
                    not exclusively programming based, but also more fundamental
                    lessons on how to tackle problems.
                </span>
                <span className="lg:mr-[30%]">
                    Aside from that, I'm a pretty normal teenager; I love to
                    travel, listen to music, go out with my friends, and of
                    course, struggle to manage my time...
                </span>
                <span className="lg:mr-[30%]">
                    I hope to continue building my knowledge of programming in
                    all aspects, in order to create the most efficient &
                    scalable code possible.
                </span>

            <PageFooter />
